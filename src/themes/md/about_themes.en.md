# Themes howto

1. First, be sure that you keep your MMDS settings in `settings.json` file.
2. Replace main HTML file with one from the theme. 
3. If your setup uses non-standard main script path, edit the new main file to fix it.
4. Add additional theme files (CSS, etc).
5. Read theme instructions and add other required settings, if any.
